# Template Part Shortcode

A (very) simple WordPress plugin for embedding template parts in your content.

## Description ##

Template parts are reusable snippets of code stored in your theme directory. Normally, they are called by other template files using the `get_template_part()` function. This plugin creates a shortcode for calling template parts from the body of a post. 

Shortcode usage is: `[template part="somepart"]`.

Template parts must be stored in a "parts" folder within your theme directory. 

If you use custom loops in your template parts, remember to use `reset_query` at the end to return the page to normal.

## Installation ##

1. Install and activate the plugin, in the normal way;
2. In your theme directory, create a subfolder called "parts";
3. Create your template part and save it into the "parts" directory -- ie. parts/somepart.php;
4. In your post Content, call the part via `[template part="somepart"]`

That's it!
